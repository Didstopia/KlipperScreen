# Audio Licenses

This file described the various licenses for all of the included audio files.

In order to simplify audio playback in KlipperScreen, some files have been converted from their original audio format to WAV, eg. by using `ffmpeg` and running `for f in *.aif; do ffmpeg -i "$f" "${f%%.*}.wav"; done` in a shell environment.

[Octave license](https://github.com/scopegate/octave/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to the following files:

- `tap-mellow.wav` (original filename: `tap-mellow.aif`)
